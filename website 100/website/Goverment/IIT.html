                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">The Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are central government owned public technical institutes located across India. They are under the ownership of Ministry of Education, Government of India. </p>
                <p>They are governed by the Institutes of Technology Act, 1961, which has declared them as Institutes of National Importance and lays down their powers, duties, and framework for governance as the country's premier institutions in the field of Technology.The Institutes of Technology Act, 1961 currently lists twenty-three IITs.Each IIT is autonomous, linked to the others through a common council (IIT Council), which oversees their administration. The Minister of Education, India is the ex officio Chairperson of the IIT Council.</p>
                <p><b><center>"History"</center></b>

                  
                  The history of the IIT system nearly dates back to 1946 when Sir Jogendra Singh of the Viceroy's Executive Council set up a committee whose task was to consider the creation of Higher Technical Institutions for post-war industrial development in India. The 22-member committee, headed by Nalini Ranjan Sarkar, recommended the establishment of these institutions in various parts of India, along the lines of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), with affiliated secondary institutions.</p>
                  <p><b><center>"Culture and student life"</center></b>
                    All the IITs provide on-campus residential facilities to the students, research scholars and faculty. The students live in hostels (sometimes referred to as halls) throughout their stay in the IIT. Students in all IITs must choose among National Cadet Corps (NCC), National Service Scheme (NSS) and National Sports Organisation (NSO) in their first years.</p>
                <a class="text-blue-500 inline-flex items-center"><b>"The Institutes of Technology Act"</b>                 
                  The Institutes of Technology act was later taken as the base for the following years up until date. The Act primarily accepted few IITs as Institutes of National Importance and converted them from 'Societies' to University status.
