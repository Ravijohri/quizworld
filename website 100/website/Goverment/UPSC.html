                <p>The Union Public Service Commission (ISO: Saṅgh Lōk Sēvā Āyōg), commonly abbreviated as UPSC, is India's premier central recruitment agency for recruitment of all the Group 'A' officers under Government of India . It is responsible for appointments to and examinations for all of the Group 'A' posts of all the union government establishments which also includes all of the central public sector units and all of the central autonomous bodies. While Department of Personnel and Training is the central personnel agency in India.</p>
                <p><b><center>"History"</center></b>
                  The Royal Commission on the superior Civil Services in India was set up under the chairmanship of Lord Lee of Fareham by the British Government in 1923. With equal numbers of Indian and British members, the commission submitted its report in 1924, recommending setting up of a Public Service Commission</p>
                  <p><b><center>"Constitutional status"</center></b>
                    
                    Articles 315 to 323 of Part XIV of the constitution, titled as Services Under the Union and the States, provide for a Public Service Commission for the Union and for each state. Accordingly, as per Art. 315, at Union level, Union Public Service Commission is envisaged by it. UPSC is amongst the few institutions which function with both autonomy and freedom, along with the country’s higher judiciary and lately the Election Commission.</p>
